Compile and Run:
For IDEs: Simply run the program using the "Run" button after pasting the code.
For Command Line:
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved TokenRing.java.
Compile the program using:
javac TokenRing.java
java TokenRing

Example Test Case:
Hereâ€™s an example of how the interaction might look:

Enter number of processes: 3
Token is with Process 0
Does Process 0 want to enter the critical section? (yes/no): yes
Process 0 is in the critical section.
Process 0 has finished. Release the token? (yes/no): yes
Token is with Process 1
Does Process 1 want to enter the critical section? (yes/no): no
Token is with Process 2
Does Process 2 want to enter the critical section? (yes/no): yes
Process 2 is in the critical section.
Process 2 has finished. Release the token? (yes/no): yes
Token is with Process 0
Does Process 0 want to enter the critical section? (yes/no): no
Token is with Process 1
